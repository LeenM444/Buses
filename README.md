# Buses
The Real-Time Bus Tracking exercise taught us to create a marker for bus stops, overlay it on a map, get an API access token and extract data from Mapbox.com, and finally to animate the marker for real-time bus tracking.  In order to use this, you will need to obtain an access code of your own from Mapbox.com as instructed below.

To use this demo:

1) Fork this repo to your own Github repository
2) From your own repo, choose the green "Code" button and from the pull-down menu choose to "Clone" using your SSH key and copy the URL
3) Go to your local Git (I use Gitbash from Windows Terminal) and type "git clone " and then paste the URL
4) Go to your IDE (I use Visual Studio) and open the folder where you saved the demo
5) Open a blank tab on your Internet browser and drag the "index.html" file to it
6) Go to Mapbox.com, create an account and request your own API access token for the Real-Time Map
7) Copy and paste your API access token into mapanimation.js where the code says 'YOUR ACCESS CODE HERE'
8) Refresh your Internet browser to see the marker move from bus stop to bus stop.
